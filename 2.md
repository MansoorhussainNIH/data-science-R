##2 - R Programming

###0) R version used

```r
print(R.version.string)
```

```
## [1] "R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10)"
```

###1) basic input & evaluation demo

```r
x <- 1
print(x)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
msg <- "hello world"
print(msg)
```

```
## [1] "hello world"
```

```r
y <- 1:20
print(y)
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```

###2) basic R objects / attributes

```r
print(class(1:10)) # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (integer vector)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
print(class(1.5)) # 1.5 (numeric)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
print(class("a")) # "a" (char)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
print(class(1+2i)) # 1+2i (complex)
```

```
## [1] "complex"
```

```r
print(class(FALSE)) # FALSE logical
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

```r
print(class(Inf)) # "Infinity"" numeric
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
print(class(NaN)) # "Not a Number" numeric
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

###3) basic vectors / lists

```r
print(class(c(1,2.3,9.6))) # vectors of numerics using concatenate 
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
print(class(c(TRUE,FALSE))) # vectors of logicals
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

```r
print(class(vector("numeric",10))) # also creates a vector of numerics
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
# if possible, R tries to coerce a vector into one singular type.
# Since "a" cannot be numeric, but numeric can be "char", that is what occurs here
print(class(c(1.7,"a"))) # "1.7", "a"
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
# logical can be represented as a numeric, TRUE being 1 and FALSE being 0
print(class(c(TRUE,2))) # 1, 2
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
# logical can also be represented as character, hence that is what occurs herel
print(class(c(FALSE,"a"))) # "FALSE", "a"
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
# the above examples are implicit coercion since it occurs without explicitly stating so
# but explicit coercion can also be done explicitly
print(class(0:6)) # normally this is an integer vector
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
print(class(as.numeric(0:6))) # but can also be explicitly coerced to be numeric vector
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

```r
print(class(as.logical(0:6))) # can also be explicitly logical.
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

```r
print(as.logical(0:6)) # 0 being false and anything else being true
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
print(class(as.character(0:6))) # can easily be coerced to be character as well
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
# nonsensical explicit coercion results in NA values (missing values)
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
print(as.numeric(x)) # since coercing chracter into numeric does not make sense, it introduces NA values
```

```
## Warning in print(as.numeric(x)): NAs introduced by coercion
```

```
## [1] NA NA NA
```

```r
# lists can include multiple different kinds of types of objects
x <- list(1,"a",TRUE,1+4i)
print(x)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "a"
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] TRUE
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 1+4i
```

###4) basic matrices

```r
m <- matrix(nrow=2, ncol=3)
print(m)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]   NA   NA   NA
## [2,]   NA   NA   NA
```

```r
dim(m) # dimension of the m (row, col)
```

```
## [1] 2 3
```

```r
attributes(m) # attributes that the matrix object can have, which is dim, and the dim values which are 2,3 (row,col)
```

```
## $dim
## [1] 2 3
```

```r
n <- matrix(1:6) # can create a single column "matrix" this way
print(n)
```

```
##      [,1]
## [1,]    1
## [2,]    2
## [3,]    3
## [4,]    4
## [5,]    5
## [6,]    6
```

```r
n <- matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3) # or create a matrix fully filled this way
print(n)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    3    5
## [2,]    2    4    6
```

```r
n <- matrix(1:7, nrow=2, ncol=3) # if the vector supplied overfills the matrix, it will put the first set that fits, but gives you warning
```

```
## Warning in matrix(1:7, nrow = 2, ncol = 3): data length [7] is not a sub-
## multiple or multiple of the number of rows [2]
```

```r
print(n)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    3    5
## [2,]    2    4    6
```

```r
o <- 1:10 # can create a matrix by setting the dimension (row, col) directly.
dim(o) <- c(5,2)
print(o)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    6
## [2,]    2    7
## [3,]    3    8
## [4,]    4    9
## [5,]    5   10
```

```r
# incorrect dimension value (such as too little or too big for the vector)
# will not let you get away with it, hence the comments to show this

#p <- 1:10
#dim(p) <- c(5,3)
#print(p)

# matrix can also be formed by column binding list of values
cbind(1:3, 10:12) 
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1   10
## [2,]    2   11
## [3,]    3   12
```

```r
# if one of the "column" in the cbind arguments is long, the other lists are extended (such as 1,2,3,4,1) by repetition, but there is a warning
cbind(1:4, 10:13, 2:6)
```

```
## Warning in cbind(1:4, 10:13, 2:6): number of rows of result is not a
## multiple of vector length (arg 1)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1   10    2
## [2,]    2   11    3
## [3,]    3   12    4
## [4,]    4   13    5
## [5,]    1   10    6
```

```r
# similar thing occurs when one of the column is too short, which the R language fixes by extending the shorter end by repetition (with warning)
cbind(1:3, 10:11)
```

```
## Warning in cbind(1:3, 10:11): number of rows of result is not a multiple of
## vector length (arg 2)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1   10
## [2,]    2   11
## [3,]    3   10
```

```r
# similar to column binding, there's also row binding.
rbind(1:3, 10:12)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    2    3
## [2,]   10   11   12
```
